## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business owner needs to generate QR codes for their physical stores to enable customers to provide voice feedback. They want to download professional-looking QR codes in different sizes for various placement locations (counter displays, wall posters, window stickers), with clear instructions in both Swedish and English to guide customers on how to scan and use the feedback system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a business has registered a store, **When** they access the QR code download center, **Then** they can generate a unique QR code that links to vocilia.com/feedback/{store_code}
2. **Given** a business owner is viewing their store's QR code, **When** they select a size variant, **Then** they receive a properly formatted version optimized for that specific use case
3. **Given** a generated QR code is downloaded, **When** printed at the specified dimensions, **Then** it remains scannable and includes the visible store code
4. **Given** a business serves Swedish and English-speaking customers, **When** they download QR materials, **Then** instructions are clearly presented in both languages
5. **Given** multiple stores exist for a business, **When** accessing the download center, **Then** each store has its own unique QR code and materials

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a store code is regenerated or changed?
- How does system handle QR codes for inactive/deleted stores?
- What if a business needs custom sizes beyond the standard variants?
- How are QR codes protected from unauthorized access/download?
- What happens if the destination URL structure changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a unique QR code for each registered store that encodes the URL vocilia.com/feedback/{store_code}
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the 6-digit store code visibly below the QR code image
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide : different variations that the user can see the QR-code in so that they can print up physical papers with the size variants for walls and windows.
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate downloadable files in PDF, PNG, and SVG formats
- **FR-005**: Each QR code material MUST include usage instructions in both Swedish and English
- **FR-006**: Business users MUST be able to access a centralized download center from their dashboard
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain print quality at : minimum DPI/resolution. I standard so that the QR code works since that is essential.
- **FR-008**: Generated QR codes MUST NOT include different styles (colors etcetera) of the QR codes.
- **FR-009**: Instructions MUST explain: exact wording for scan instructions, cashback information, privacy notice, the instructions must be clear on how this projec/business work.
- **FR-010**: System MUST track which QR codes have been downloaded and when
- **FR-011**: QR codes MUST remain functional even if printed in black and white
- **FR-012**: Download center MUST allow bulk download of all store QR codes for multi-location businesses

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Store**: Physical business location with unique 6-digit code, name, and address
- **QR Code Configuration**: Size variant (counter/wall/window), format (PDF/PNG/SVG), language settings
- **Generated QR Asset**: The actual file containing QR code, store code, instructions, and branding
- **Download History**: Record of when and which QR codes were downloaded by business users

## Additional Clarifications Needed

1. **Size Specifications**: What are the exact dimensions for counter, wall, and window variants? I do not know, think about it and come up with solutions.
2. **Branding Requirements**: Should QR codes include Vocilia logo, brand colors, or other visual elements? Using the vocilia logo in the QR codes would be awesome. Use the logo which is; <svg viewBox="0 0 200 60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Define gradient -->
  <defs>
    <!-- Main gradient from marine blue to purple -->
    <linearGradient id="waveGradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%">
      <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#0077BE;stop-opacity:1" />
      <stop offset="50%" style="stop-color:#4A90E2;stop-opacity:1" />
      <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#7B68EE;stop-opacity:1" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>

  <!-- Vocilia text centered -->
  <text x="100" y="35" 
        text-anchor="middle"
        font-family="'Segoe UI', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif" 
        font-size="32" 
        font-weight="600" 
        font-style="italic"
        fill="url(#waveGradient)">
    Vocilia
  </text>
</svg>    and have a white background. 
3. **Instruction Content**: What specific text should appear in Swedish and English instructions? Just inform the business-owner about what they are "signing up" for. 
4. **Print Specifications**: What minimum resolution/DPI is required for print quality? I do not know, do research and make it work. 
5. **Access Control**: Should there be restrictions on who can download QR codes within an organization? No, the business account can do it which may be some boss or something like that at the business. 
6. **Update Policy**: If store codes change, how should existing printed QR codes be handled? I do not know, come up with a solution.
