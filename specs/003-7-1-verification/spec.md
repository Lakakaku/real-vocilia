## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: Payment verification system for weekly business-admin data exchange
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Businesses, Admin system
   ’ Actions: Download, verify, upload payment batches
   ’ Data: CSV files with transaction details, verification results
   ’ Constraints: 7-day deadline, fraud detection, audit requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: CSV format specifications]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific fraud detection criteria]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Admin sends batch ’ Business verifies ’ Business uploads results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on verifiable system behaviors
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Payment batches, verification results, audit logs
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Implementation details avoided, focus on business value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Businesses receive weekly payment batches from the admin system and must verify transaction legitimacy within a 7-day deadline. The system provides a dedicated dashboard section where businesses can download transaction details, compare against their POS records, mark transactions as verified or fraudulent, and upload results back to admin. The verification process includes fraud detection assistance, real-time countdown timers, and automated approval for missed deadlines.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** admin has sent a payment batch, **When** business accesses dashboard, **Then** verification section appears with countdown timer and batch download option
2. **Given** business downloads batch CSV, **When** they review transaction details, **Then** they can compare timestamps and amounts against POS records
3. **Given** business completes verification process, **When** they upload verified CSV, **Then** system validates format and confirms successful submission
4. **Given** 7-day deadline passes without upload, **When** system auto-approval triggers, **Then** all transactions are marked as legitimate and admin is notified
5. **Given** suspicious patterns detected, **When** business reviews flagged items, **Then** AI provides risk scores and verification recommendations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when business uploads invalid CSV format?
- How does system handle partial verifications (some transactions unmarked)?
- What occurs if business disputes admin's fraud detection suggestions?
- How are timezone differences handled for deadline calculations?
- What backup processes exist if file uploads fail repeatedly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display verification section in business dashboard when payment batch is received from admin
- **FR-002**: System MUST show real-time countdown timer with exact days, hours, and minutes remaining until 7-day deadline
- **FR-003**: Businesses MUST be able to download payment batch CSV files containing transaction details
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide CSV preview interface showing transaction data before verification begins
- **FR-005**: Businesses MUST be able to mark each transaction as "YES" (verified) or "NO-REASON" (fraudulent with explanation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate uploaded CSV format matches original structure with verification column added
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide verification status tracking showing progress through stages: received, downloaded, in-progress, uploaded
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically approve all transactions if deadline passes without business upload
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate risk scores (0-100) for transactions based on anomaly patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST flag suspicious transactions with specific fraud indicators for business review
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide AI-powered verification recommendations for flagged transactions
- **FR-012**: System MUST create complete audit trail of all verification activities and data exchanges
