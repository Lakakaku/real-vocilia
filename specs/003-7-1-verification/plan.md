# Implementation Plan: Payment Verification Dashboard System

**Branch**: `003-7-1-verification` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [/specs/003-7-1-verification/spec.md](/Users/lucasjenner/vocilia/specs/003-7-1-verification/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-7-1-verification/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected: Next.js web application with Supabase backend
   → Set Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section
   → Template constitution - requirements analysis needed
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Prerequisites assessed for simplicity and compliance
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Resolving CSV format specifications and fraud detection criteria
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-design validation for new violations
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create a comprehensive payment verification dashboard system for weekly business-admin data exchange with 7-day deadlines, fraud detection, and automated approval. Technical approach: Leverage existing Next.js/Supabase architecture with new database tables for payment batches, verification results, and audit logging. Utilize React Hook Form for CSV processing, Supabase RLS for security, and AI integration for fraud detection assistance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5+ / Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14.2.5, Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.39.3), React Hook Form 7.62.0, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Zod 3.23.8
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with existing business/store schema, new verification tables needed
**Testing**: Vitest (inferred from project type), React Testing Library, contract testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (business.vocilia.com), mobile-responsive
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s verification page load, <5s CSV upload processing, real-time countdown updates
**Constraints**: 7-day verification deadline management, CSV file size limits, fraud detection accuracy >90%
**Scale/Scope**: Support 50+ businesses, 1000+ weekly transactions, 7-day rolling verification windows

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Analysis based on template constitution structure:**
- ✅ **Library-First Principle**: Payment verification can be built as modular components within existing Next.js structure
- ✅ **Integration Testing Requirements**: New verification APIs and CSV processing require comprehensive contract tests
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Building on existing authentication and database patterns rather than introducing new architectures
- ⚠️ **Complexity Considerations**: AI fraud detection and real-time updates add system complexity but provide core business value

**Initial Assessment**: CONDITIONAL PASS - Complexity justified by business requirements for fraud prevention and user experience

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application with existing Next.js App Router structure, extending business dashboard functionality

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - CSV format specifications for payment batches and verification results
   - Fraud detection algorithms and scoring criteria (0-100 scale)
   - Real-time countdown timer implementation patterns
   - Supabase file upload/download best practices for CSV handling
   - AI integration patterns with OpenAI for verification recommendations

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For CSV format specifications:
     Task: "Research CSV schema design for payment verification workflows"
   For fraud detection criteria:
     Task: "Define fraud scoring algorithm for transaction verification"
   For real-time updates:
     Task: "Find best practices for countdown timers and real-time status in Next.js"
   For file handling:
     Task: "Research Supabase storage patterns for CSV upload/download with validation"
   For AI integration:
     Task: "Find best practices for OpenAI integration in verification workflows"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - PaymentBatch: Weekly transaction collections with deadline tracking
   - VerificationResult: Business approval/rejection responses with audit trails
   - VerificationSession: Manages verification workflow state and progress
   - AuditLog: Complete activity tracking for compliance
   - FraudAssessment: AI-generated risk scores and recommendations

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - GET /api/verification/batches - Retrieve current payment batch
   - POST /api/verification/download - Download payment batch CSV
   - POST /api/verification/upload - Upload verified CSV results
   - GET /api/verification/status - Real-time verification status
   - POST /api/verification/audit - Create audit log entries
   - GET /api/admin/batches - Admin batch management
   - POST /api/admin/release - Release batches to businesses

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint with request/response validation
   - CSV format validation tests
   - Authentication and authorization tests
   - Error handling and edge case validation

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Complete verification workflow integration test
   - Deadline expiration and auto-approval scenario
   - Fraud detection and recommendation flow
   - CSV upload validation and error recovery

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add verification system context to CLAUDE.md
   - Include recent payment verification implementation
   - Maintain token efficiency under 150 lines

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate database migration tasks for new verification tables [P]
- Create API endpoint implementation tasks from contracts
- Build React component tasks for verification UI
- Implement AI fraud detection integration tasks
- Add real-time countdown timer functionality tasks
- Create comprehensive testing tasks for verification workflows

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Database schema → API contracts → UI components
- Dependency order: Core models → Services → API → UI → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where components are independent
- Frontend and backend verification components can be built in parallel

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering database, API, UI, AI integration, and testing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| AI fraud detection complexity | Business requirement for 90%+ accuracy in fraud prevention | Manual verification alone insufficient for scale and accuracy |
| Real-time countdown timers | Critical UX for 7-day deadline management | Static deadlines create poor user experience and missed deadlines |
| Multiple CSV processing workflows | Required for admin-business data exchange cycle | Single workflow cannot handle bidirectional verification requirements |
