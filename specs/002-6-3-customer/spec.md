# Feature Specification: Customer Entry Flow

**Feature Branch**: `002-6-3-customer`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### 6.3 Customer Entry Flow
**Agent: frontend-specialist + mobile-responsive**
- [ ] Create minimal landing page at vocilia.com
- [ ] Build 6-digit code entry form
- [ ] Implement code validation
- [ ] Create redirect to vocilia.com/feedback/{store_code}
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid codes
- [ ] Optimize for mobile QR code scanning"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer arriving at a Vocilia-enabled business, I scan a QR code that takes me to the Vocilia website. I then enter the 6-digit store code displayed near the QR code (or embedded in the QR code) to access the feedback interface for that specific store location. The system validates my code and redirects me to the appropriate feedback page where I can provide voice feedback about my experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer has scanned a QR code on their mobile device, **When** they land on vocilia.com, **Then** they see a clear, mobile-optimized form to enter a 6-digit store code
2. **Given** a customer enters a valid 6-digit store code, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they are redirected to vocilia.com/feedback/{store_code} where they can provide feedback
3. **Given** a customer enters an invalid store code, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they see a clear error message indicating the code is invalid and are prompted to try again
4. **Given** a customer is using a mobile device, **When** they access the landing page, **Then** the interface is fully responsive with large touch targets and readable text
5. **Given** a customer enters a store code with spaces or special characters, **When** they submit, **Then** the system sanitizes the input and validates only the numeric digits

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a customer enters fewer than 6 digits? System displays an error message indicating exactly 6 digits are required
- How does system handle expired or deactivated store codes? Should expired codes show specific message vs generic "invalid code"? Invalid code should be displayed
- What happens when network connection is lost during redirect? Browser handles redirect failure, but; Should we show offline message or rely on browser behavior? Come up with the best solution
- How does system handle rapid repeated submissions?  Rate limiting requirements not specified: I do not know, come up with the most reasonable answer
- What happens if customer bookmarks the landing page? Page remains functional for future visits

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a landing page at vocilia.com that displays a store code entry form
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept exactly 6 numeric digits as valid store code input
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that entered store codes exist in the system database
- **FR-004**: System MUST redirect valid code entries to vocilia.com/feedback/{store_code}
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear error messages for invalid store codes
- **FR-006**: Landing page MUST be optimized for mobile devices (responsive design, touch-friendly)
- **FR-007**: Form MUST sanitize input to accept only numeric characters (stripping spaces, dashes, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle form submission without requiring customer authentication
- **FR-009**: Error messages MUST be user-friendly and guide customers to correct action
- **FR-010**: Landing page MUST load quickly on mobile networks. Specific performance target in seconds? I want it to go fast, but I do not know exactly how fast, you can set up a fast-goal.
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities in code validation
- **FR-012**: Form MUST be accessible to users with disabilities : WCAG compliance level required? No, not in this stage of the process

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Store Code**: 6-digit numeric identifier that uniquely identifies a business location, used to route customers to the correct feedback interface
- **Store**: Business location entity that the store code references, containing business information and feedback configuration
- **Validation Response**: Result of store code validation containing either success with redirect URL or failure with error details
