# VERIFICATION.md - Vocilia Weekly Verification System

## Critical Notice: Real Money & Real Businesses
‚ö†Ô∏è **PRODUCTION SYSTEM** - All verifications involve real money and real businesses ‚ö†Ô∏è

Every verification affects actual customer payments. Handle with extreme care. Test with minimal amounts (1-5 SEK) during development.

## System Overview

The verification system ensures feedback legitimacy through a weekly cycle where businesses verify customer transactions against their POS systems before payments are processed.

### Key Principles
1. **7-Day Window:** Businesses have exactly 7 days to verify
2. **Manual First:** Start with manual verification, automation comes later
3. **Dual Database:** Separate databases for all feedback vs. payment batch
4. **Consolidation:** Multiple feedbacks per phone number = single payment
5. **Auto-Approval:** Unverified batches auto-approve after deadline

## Weekly Cycle Timeline

### Week Structure
```

- Adjust obvious errors
- Remove confirmed fraud

#### Batch Generation
```sql
-- Generate payment batch for each business
SELECT
  f.id as transaction_id,
  f.transaction_time,
  f.transaction_amount,
  RIGHT(f.phone_number, 4) as phone_last4,
  s.store_code,
  f.quality_score,
  f.reward_amount
FROM feedbacks f
JOIN stores s ON f.store_id = s.id
WHERE s.business_id = {business_id}
  AND f.week_number = {current_week}
  AND f.is_fraudulent = false
ORDER BY f.transaction_time;
```

5. Reasonable approval rate

### Step 5: Deadline Management

#### Countdown Display
```javascript
// Real-time countdown
function getTimeRemaining(deadline) {
  const now = new Date();
  const end = new Date(deadline);
  const diff = end - now;

  return {
    days: Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)),
    hours: Math.floor((diff / (1000 * 60 * 60)) % 24),
    minutes: Math.floor((diff / (1000 * 60)) % 60),
    isUrgent: diff < (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Less than 24 hours
    isOverdue: diff < 0
  };
}
```

#### Reminder Schedule
```
Day 1 (Monday 09:00):    "New verification batch available"
Day 3 (Wednesday 09:00):  "4 days remaining to verify"
Day 5 (Friday 09:00):     "48 hours left - verification deadline approaching"
Day 6 (Saturday 09:00):   "URGENT: 24 hours to submit verification"
Day 7 (Sunday 09:00):     "FINAL NOTICE: Verify by 17:00 today"
Day 7 (Sunday 15:00):     "2 HOURS LEFT: Submit verification now"
```

#### Auto-Approval Process
If deadline passes without upload:
```sql
-- Auto-approve unverified batches
UPDATE verifications
SET
  status = 'auto_approved',
  auto_approved = true,
  completed_at = NOW(),
  admin_notes = 'Auto-approved: Deadline passed'
WHERE deadline < NOW()
  AND status IN ('pending', 'in_progress');

-- Mark all feedback as verified
UPDATE feedbacks f
SET is_verified = true
FROM verifications v
WHERE v.id = {verification_id}
  AND f.week_number = v.week_number;
```

### Step 6: Admin Processing

#### Processing Verified Databases
```javascript
// Admin processes returned verifications
async function processVerification(verificationId) {
  const verification = await getVerification(verificationId);
  const items = await parseCSV(verification.csv_url);

  let approved = 0;
  let rejected = 0;
  let totalRewards = 0;

  for (const item of items) {
    if (item.verified === 'YES') {
      approved++;
      totalRewards += item.reward_amount;
      await approveFeedback(item.transaction_id);
    } else {
      rejected++;
      await rejectFeedback(item.transaction_id, item.verified);
    }
  }

  return {
    approved,
    rejected,
    totalRewards,
    platformFee: totalRewards * 0.20,
    invoiceTotal: totalRewards * 1.20
  };
}
```

#### Payment Consolidation
```javascript
// Consolidate multiple feedbacks per phone
function consolidatePayments(feedbacks) {
  const consolidated = {};

  feedbacks.forEach(feedback => {
    const phone = feedback.phone_number;
    if (!consolidated[phone]) {
      consolidated[phone] = {
        phone_number: phone,
        total_amount: 0,
        feedback_count: 0,
        feedback_ids: []
      };
    }

    consolidated[phone].total_amount += feedback.reward_amount;
    consolidated[phone].feedback_count++;
    consolidated[phone].feedback_ids.push(feedback.id);
  });

  return Object.values(consolidated);
}
```

### Step 7: Payment & Invoicing

#### Generate Swish Batch
```javascript
// Create Swish payment batch
const swishBatch = consolidatedPayments.map(payment => ({
  payeePaymentReference: `W${weekNumber}-${year}`,
  callbackUrl: 'https://vocilia.com/api/webhooks/swish',
  payeeAlias: '1234567890', // Vocilia Swish number
  payerAlias: payment.phone_number,
  amount: payment.total_amount,
  currency: 'SEK',
  message: `Vocilia feedback reward Week ${weekNumber}`
}));
```

#### Invoice Generation
```javascript
// Generate business invoice
const invoice = {
  number: `2024-W${weekNumber}-${businessId}`,
  business: businessName,
  items: [
    {
      description: 'Customer Feedback Rewards',
      quantity: approvedCount,
      amount: totalRewards
    },
    {
      description: 'Platform Service Fee (20%)',
      quantity: 1,
      amount: totalRewards * 0.20
    }
  ],
  total: totalRewards * 1.20,
  dueDate: addDays(new Date(), 10),
  paymentTerms: 'Net 10 days'
};
```

## Fraud Detection Patterns

### Automated Fraud Indicators

#### Time-Based Patterns
```javascript
const fraudIndicators = {
  // Feedback outside business hours
  outsideHours: (time, businessHours) => {
    return !isWithinHours(time, businessHours);
  },

  // Multiple feedbacks in short timeframe
  rapidFeedback: (feedbacks, phone) => {
    const phoneFeedbacks = feedbacks.filter(f => f.phone === phone);
    return phoneFeedbacks.length > 3 &&
           timeDifference(phoneFeedbacks) < 60; // minutes
  },

  // Suspicious timing patterns
  roundTimes: (time) => {
    const minutes = time.getMinutes();
    return minutes === 0 || minutes === 30;
  }
};
```

#### Amount-Based Patterns
```javascript
const amountPatterns = {
  // Suspiciously round amounts
  roundAmounts: (amount) => {
    return amount % 100 === 0 && amount > 500;
  },

  // Outside typical range
  unusualAmount: (amount, businessAverage) => {
    return amount > businessAverage * 3 ||
           amount < businessAverage * 0.1;
  },

  // Duplicate amounts from same phone
  duplicateAmounts: (feedbacks, phone) => {
    const amounts = feedbacks
      .filter(f => f.phone === phone)
      .map(f => f.amount);
    return new Set(amounts).size !== amounts.length;
  }
};
```

#### Content-Based Patterns
```javascript
const contentPatterns = {
  // Generic feedback
  genericContent: (transcript) => {
    const genericPhrases = [
      'everything was fine',
      'no problems',
      'all good'
    ];
    return genericPhrases.some(phrase =>
      transcript.toLowerCase().includes(phrase)
    );
  },

  // Inconsistent details
  wrongContext: (transcript, context) => {
    // Mentions staff/products that don't exist
    const mentions = extractMentions(transcript);
    return !mentions.every(m => context.includes(m));
  },

  // Copied feedback
  duplicateContent: (transcript, allTranscripts) => {
    return allTranscripts.filter(t =>
      similarity(t, transcript) > 0.9
    ).length > 1;
  }
};
```

### Manual Review Triggers

**High Risk Indicators:**
1. Same phone, multiple stores, same day
2. Claimed amount differs >20% from POS
3. Feedback mentions competitor names
4. Technical impossibilities (closed department, non-existent product)
5. Pattern of maximum rewards (always 15% tier)

**Risk Scoring:**
```javascript
function calculateFraudRisk(feedback) {
  let riskScore = 0;

  // Time anomalies (weight: 20)
  if (outsideBusinessHours(feedback.time)) riskScore += 20;
  if (suspiciousTimePattern(feedback.time)) riskScore += 10;

  // Amount anomalies (weight: 30)
  if (roundAmount(feedback.amount)) riskScore += 15;
  if (unusualAmount(feedback.amount)) riskScore += 15;

  // Content anomalies (weight: 30)
  if (genericFeedback(feedback.transcript)) riskScore += 20;
  if (contextMismatch(feedback.transcript)) riskScore += 30;

  // Pattern anomalies (weight: 20)
  if (rapidMultipleFeedback(feedback.phone)) riskScore += 20;

  return Math.min(riskScore, 100);
}

// Risk levels
const riskLevels = {
  low: score => score < 30,
  medium: score => score >= 30 && score < 60,
  high: score => score >= 60 && score < 80,
  critical: score => score >= 80
};
```

- Dashboard for exceptions only

### Phase 4: Full Automation (Month 10-12)
- Real-time verification as feedback arrives
- Machine learning for fraud detection
- Predictive approval recommendations
- Zero-touch for trusted businesses

## Verification Best Practices

### For Businesses
1. **Set a Schedule:** Dedicate time each Monday
2. **Use POS Reports:** Export week's transactions
3. **Batch Process:** Review all items at once
4. **Document Rejections:** Note why items rejected
5. **Track Patterns:** Watch for repeat issues

### For Admin
1. **Monitor Progress:** Check daily during verification week
2. **Send Reminders:** Proactive communication
3. **Review Auto-Approvals:** Check for patterns
4. **Analyze Rejections:** Identify fraud trends
5. **Support Businesses:** Help with verification issues

### For Developers
1. **Test with Minimal Amounts:** 1-5 SEK only
2. **Use Test Prefixes:** "Test Business Stockholm"
3. **Clean Test Data:** Remove after verification
4. **Monitor Logs:** Track all verification actions
5. **Validate CSVs:** Ensure format compliance

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### CSV Format Errors
```javascript
// Validation before upload
function validateCSV(file) {
  const errors = [];

  // Check headers
  const requiredHeaders = [
    'Transaction_ID',
    'Verified',
    'Verification_Notes'
  ];

  const headers = parseHeaders(file);
  requiredHeaders.forEach(h => {
    if (!headers.includes(h)) {
      errors.push(`Missing required column: ${h}`);
    }
  });

  // Check verification codes
  const validCodes = ['YES', 'NO-NOT_FOUND', 'NO-FRAUD',
                     'NO-TIME_MISMATCH', 'NO-AMOUNT_MISMATCH'];

  rows.forEach((row, i) => {
    if (!validCodes.includes(row.Verified)) {
      errors.push(`Row ${i}: Invalid verification code`);
    }
  });

  return errors;
}
```

#### Deadline Missed
```sql
-- Recovery process for missed deadlines
-- 1. Check if auto-approved
SELECT * FROM verifications
WHERE business_id = ?
  AND week_number = ?
  AND auto_approved = true;

-- 2. Allow late submission (admin discretion)
UPDATE verifications
SET
  status = 'late_submission',
  deadline = deadline + INTERVAL '24 hours'
WHERE id = ?;

-- 3. Process late verification
-- Apply late submission penalty or note
```

#### Duplicate Uploads
```javascript
// Prevent duplicate processing
async function handleUpload(file, verificationId) {
  // Check if already processed
  const existing = await getVerification(verificationId);
  if (existing.status === 'completed') {
    throw new Error('Verification already completed');
  }

  // Check file hash to prevent duplicates
  const fileHash = calculateHash(file);
  if (existing.file_hash === fileHash) {
    throw new Error('This file has already been uploaded');
  }

  // Process new upload
  return processVerification(file, verificationId);
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
1. **Phone Masking:** Only show last 4 digits
2. **Secure Transfer:** HTTPS for all CSV transfers
3. **Access Control:** Business sees only their data
4. **Audit Trail:** Log all verification actions
5. **Data Retention:** Delete CSVs after 90 days

### Verification Integrity
1. **Tamper Detection:** Hash verification for uploads
2. **Version Control:** Track all CSV modifications
3. **Business Isolation:** Prevent cross-business access
4. **Admin Oversight:** All auto-approvals logged
5. **Fraud Prevention:** Multi-layer validation

## Support Procedures

### Business Support
- **Email:** verification-support@vocilia.com
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours during verification week
- **Common Issues:** CSV format, deadline extensions, POS matching

### Technical Support
- **Slack:** #verification-issues
- **On-Call:** During Sunday deadline hours
- **Escalation:** Admin can manually extend deadlines

### Emergency Procedures
1. **System Outage:** Extend all deadlines by outage duration
2. **Data Loss:** Restore from hourly backups
3. **Mass Failure:** Admin manual intervention
4. **Security Breach:** Immediate verification freeze
